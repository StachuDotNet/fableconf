## Title

Fable for busy dads: how Fable helps me to spend more time with my children

## Duration

45 minutes

## Abstract

Fable's motto could be: if it compiles then it works. 
As a freelancer, using a functional language in Creepy Mutable Land just allows me to code faster, to release sooner and of course, to avoid running after runtime errors.

With 3 kids, 2 cats and 3 chicken at home I just don't want to spend time on strange runtime errors creeping from mutable underworld.
And if I want to remain competitive, the only errors I can accept are logical ones coming from my own nasty code and CSS compatibility junk.

But JS is everywhere. And while the language has thousands problems, the JS ecosystem is just awesome. So why stick with JS when I can use F#?


- I need to ship things early with NO bugs. 
- I need to understand my code when adding features months later. 
- I need my business logic to flow naturally from my mind to the code sheet.
- I need to be able to plug in any JS libs needed whithout worrying about side effects on my project.
- I want to be able to get started in a few seconds
- I want live reloads while I'm coding
- I want to code JS apps with real completion, syntax errors highlighting, refactoring enabled
- I need to be productive and...

*I just want to spend time reading stories to my kids and sleep at night.*
