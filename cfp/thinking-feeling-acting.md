Title

Thinking Feeling Acting agents - Train an AI spacecraft to explore in your browser  

Duration

45 minutes

Abstract
We will look at how to train an Recurrent Neural Network based agent (spacecraft) to navigate a simulated asteroid field.
Unlike the game playing Deep Learning methods that use the screen pixels as the input, our agent is situated in the environment
that it is acting in. It sees the world around it using its sensors. It decides where to look and what to pay attention to.
It decides when to use the thrusters to move but it has to conserve its limited fuel. We will look at how to use evolutionary strategies 
to train these and a bit of philosophical view of what AI is and can be.
